###Cloning
First of all you will have to clone the library.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lsjwzh/loadingeverywhere.git
```

Getting Started
---------------
###Base usage

####LoadingLayout

Ok lets start with your activities or fragments xml file. It might look something like this.
```xml
<com.lsjwzh.loadingeverywhere.LoadingLayout
    android:id="@+id/loading"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

Also in your activities `onCreate()` or your fragments `onCreateView()` you would want to wrap a LoadingLayout like this
```java
LoadingLayout loadingLayout = LoadingLayout.wrap(findViewById(R.id.list));
```
`LoadingLayout.wrap` method can be called any where.
Because LoadingLayout will replace the view's position until the view has been attach to view tree.

You can also use custom progressBar style in LoadingLayout like this:
```java
LoadingLayout loadingLayout = LoadingLayout.wrap(findViewById(R.id.list),android.R.attr.progressBarStyleLarge);
```

####ProgressLayout
ProgressLayout has the same usage as LoadingLayout above.
Xml Define:
```xml
<com.lsjwzh.loadingeverywhere.ProgressLayout
    android:id="@+id/progress"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```
code:
```java
ProgressLayout progressLayout = ProgressLayout.wrap(findViewById(R.id.list));
```

```java
ProgressLayout progressLayout = ProgressLayout.wrap(findViewById(R.id.list),android.R.attr.progressBarStyleLarge);
```

####MaskLayout

Contributing
------------
Contributions are very welcome. Now that this library has grown in popularity i have a hard time keeping upp with all the issues while tending to a multitude of other projects as well as school. So if you find a bug in the library or want a feature and think you can fix it yourself, fork + pull request and i will greatly appreciate it!

I love getting pull requests for new features as well as bugs. However, when it comes to new features please also explain the use case and way you think the library should include it. If you don't want to start coding a feature without knowing if the feature will have chance of being included, open an issue and we can discuss the feature!
